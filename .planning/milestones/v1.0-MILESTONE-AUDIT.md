# v1.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** Auth & User History
**Audited:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** PASSED
**Score:** 23/23 requirements satisfied

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

Each requirement verified against three independent sources: phase VERIFICATION.md, SUMMARY.md frontmatter, and REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1. Auth Foundation | human_needed | 13/13 | All automated checks pass; 7 browser tests pending |
| 2. Database Infrastructure | no verification file | N/A | Infrastructure only; no direct requirements |
| 3. Transcript Persistence | passed | 11/11 | Clean |
| 4. History List | passed | 11/11 | Clean |
| 5. History Actions | passed | 10/10 | Clean |
| 6. Advanced History | passed | 10/10 | Clean |
| 7. Duplicate Detection | passed | 7/7 | Clean |

**All phases with requirements have VERIFICATION.md files.** Phase 2 is infrastructure with no requirements mapped; its correctness is validated by all downstream phases (3-7) passing.

## Integration Checker Report

### API Route Coverage: 6/6

| Route | Method | Consumers | Status |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| /api/auth/[...nextauth] | GET/POST | Auth.js OAuth flow | CONSUMED |
| /api/transcript | POST | app/page.tsx | CONSUMED |
| /api/metadata | GET | app/page.tsx | CONSUMED |
| /api/transcript/save | POST | SaveTranscript component | CONSUMED |
| /api/transcript/delete | POST | HistoryCard, HistoryActions, TranscriptDetail, TranscriptDetailActions | CONSUMED |
| /api/transcript/check | GET | SaveTranscript component | CONSUMED |

### Auth Protection: Complete

All sensitive routes are auth-protected server-side. proxy.ts provides client-side route interception (Next.js 16 proxy convention, confirmed active in build output as "Proxy (Middleware)").

### E2E Flows: 10/10

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| 1. User Authentication | SignIn → OAuth → DB → JWT → UI | Complete |
| 2. Transcript Auto-Save | Generate → Pre-check → Save → Toast | Complete |
| 3. Unauthenticated Access | Generate → Copy (no save) | Complete |
| 4. View History | Dropdown → /history → Cards | Complete |
| 5. View Detail | Card click → /history/[id] → Full transcript | Complete |
| 6. Copy from History | Copy button → Clipboard → Toast | Complete |
| 7. Delete Transcript | Delete → AlertDialog → API → Refresh | Complete |
| 8. Bulk Delete | Select mode → Checkboxes → Bulk delete | Complete |
| 9. Search History | Search input → useMemo filter → Results | Complete |
| 10. Format Switch & Download | Format select → Copy/Download in format | Complete |

### Cross-Phase Wiring

All 32 cross-phase exports properly wired. No orphaned components, no unused exports, no dead API routes. The integration checker flagged proxy.ts as "orphaned middleware" but this is a false positive: Next.js 16 uses proxy.ts (not middleware.ts), and the build output confirms it is active ("Proxy (Middleware)").

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 1: Auth Foundation
- 7 manual browser tests remain unexecuted (OAuth flow, session persistence, dropdown appearance, protected route redirect, sign-in hint, sign-out flow, loading skeleton). All automated verification passes.

### Phase 2: Database Infrastructure
- Missing VERIFICATION.md. This phase is infrastructure with no direct requirements. Its correctness is validated by all dependent phases passing their verifications.

**Total: 2 items across 2 phases. No blockers.**

## Anti-Patterns

Zero anti-patterns found across all 7 phases. No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments, no stub implementations, no empty handlers, no console.log-only patterns.

## Build Status

All phases pass `npm run build` with zero TypeScript errors. All routes registered correctly.
